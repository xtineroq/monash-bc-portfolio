      "bio":"Hi there! I'm a month away from becoming a Full Stack Developer - woohoo! Currently juggling my 24-hour/week 9 to 5 job, 20-hour/week freelance job and being a student at Monash University's Coding Bootcamp. Yes, I'm flat out. Having been working as a contractor for a Digital Marketing Agency, I am exposed to all sorts of aspects of building a website. Aside from seeing our web developers, UX/UI designers, etc. in action and getting inspired at what they do, I have always had this desire of being able to design, build and code a website or an application myself. That of which fuels my goal to quit my day job and become a full-time freelancer.",
